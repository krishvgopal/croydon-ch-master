    <h1>Dear Sir/Madam</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Housing benefit overpayment &ndash; final notice re:</strong> <strong>&laquo;clname&raquo;</strong></p>

    <p>&laquo;claddress1&raquo; &laquo;claddress2&raquo; &laquo;claddress3&raquo; &laquo;claddress4&raquo; &laquo;clpostcode&raquo;</p>

    <p>Invoice number: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &laquo;inv_no&raquo;</p>

    <p>Total invoice amount:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &pound;&laquo;invamount&raquo;</p>

    <p>Amount outstanding:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &pound;&laquo;os_amount&raquo;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Our records show that you have failed to pay the above outstanding Housing Benefit invoice to Croydon Council.&nbsp; I must now inform you that we intend to recover overpaid Housing Benefit that has been paid to you either by reducing the amount of Housing Benefit paid out to you (Direct Recovery from Landlord) or by applying to the County Court to have your debt of Housing Benefit registered as an order of court.&nbsp; <strong>No further reminders will be sent.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>If an arrangement to pay this debt is agreed with me within 7 days of the date of this letter, direct recovery from landlord and recovery by court action may be suspended.&nbsp; Please contact the Recovery Team on 020 8667 8246 (Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm) in order to agree a suitable arrangement.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Direct Recovery from Landlord </strong></p>

    <p>I need to advise you, as a landlord who may receive direct payments of Housing Benefit on behalf of your tenants, of an important aspect of Benefit legislation that may apply regarding the recovery of Housing Benefit overpayments.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We can recover overpaid Housing Benefit that has been paid to you by reducing the amount of Housing Benefit paid. &nbsp;To do this we may reduce the amount of benefit paid to you for a tenant who does not have the overpayment. &nbsp;This is in accordance with Section 16 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Housing Benefit (recovery of overpayments) Regulations 1997 state that the rent liability for the tenant whose benefit has been reduced will be deemed to be paid to the full value of their Housing Benefit entitlement. This means that you must credit the rent account of the affected tenant with the amount of Housing Benefit they were actually entitled to.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Recovery by Court Action</strong></p>

    <p>I must also inform you that under section 75(7) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 an application can be made to have your debt of Housing Benefit registered as an order of court.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The County Court will then send you an order to pay and you may have to meet additional costs.&nbsp; Failure to pay the Court Order means that the debt can then be recovered by any of the following methods:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Referral to an external Debt Collection Agency;</li>
        <li>A warrant of execution giving court bailiffs the authority to seize goods;</li>
        <li>An attachment of earnings order which permits deductions direct from your earnings;</li>
        <li>A third party debt order which allows payment direct from bank/building society accounts;</li>
        <li>A charging order which prevents sale of assets unless the debt is cleared.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET CREDIT IN FUTURE IF YOU HAVE A COUNTY COURT JUDGEMENT REGISTERED AGAINST YOU.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Yours faithfully</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
